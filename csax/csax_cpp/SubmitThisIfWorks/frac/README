This is a specialized version of FRaC[1,2]:

The feature models are SVMs 

Only real-valued features are considered (i.e. the models use SVR).

	Notes: To include nominal values in this version, one would have to write
	additional code to (i) identify the nominal features either automatically
	or via additional input, (ii) adjust the learning algorithm (iii) implement
	a separate error model (e.g. a confusion matrix).

The error model is a Gaussian (as opposed to the smoothed histogram used in [1,2]).

	We find this model is simpler, and at least as accurate as [1,2],
	especially with limited training instances.

This version does not handle *missing* values.

	This is for simplicity of implementation only.  The FRaC algorithm handles
	missing values specially, but this code will assume that all values are
	present.

This code is based on LIBSVM[3] version 3.1 (April 1st 2011).  The purpose is a
faster version of FRaC that uses less temporary file storage.
