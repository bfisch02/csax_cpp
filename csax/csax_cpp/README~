CSAX in C++ Reimplementation by Brett Fischler and Jacob Gerace

To run, you will need the following on your system:
-R
-Java
-g++
-gzip to unzip frac's ns.gz file

This was tested on Ubuntu 14.0 with the lastest version of all 3 of them.
Currently this compiles but does not run due to an r error on the tufts cs
servers.

Make sure not to replace frac.r with the provided version of frac.r, we
have modified it to output the whole gene vs sample anomaly score table,
which is put into output_directory

The provided file is also put into output_directory/CSAX_anomaly_scores

You can run on the example set from the CSAX download via:
./runOnLong

(You may need to chmod runOnLong to make it executable)

To get a quick run of our program please use ./runOnShort, which runs on
only the first 249 gene data from examples.input

The syntax for running is:
./CSAX -B <number of bags> <training set file> <test set file> <gene set
files> output_location

please use "output_location" for the last argument verbatim, as that is
where we have specified FRaC to put its files

The format of the input files is identical to that specified by the
original CSAX implementation written in R, please see their documentation
for details.

A sample output when run on the entire example set over 40 bagging
iterations is:
