%Here are the papers.  The ICDM10 one introduces the ideas behind FRAC;
%the FRAC12 paper fleshes these out (a journal version that overlaps
%somewhat with the conference paper but adds some material about
%robustness and supervision).  These are just machine learning
%algorithms, no biology.

%Then we do CSAX, which is the first to focus on expression data and gene
%sets.  (This was the recomb conference paper from 2014.)  The "mad.pdf"
%is the journal submission of the recomb paper, which cuts out some of
%the material from the recomb version but adds a section on applications
%to developmental data.
